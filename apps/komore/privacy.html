	<h1>Komore Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-08</p>

	<p>Komore is an AI-powered poetry generation app that creates poems from your photos. This Privacy Policy explains
		how Komore collects and uses device features and data when you use the App.</p>

	<h2>1. Data and device features the App uses</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> The App accesses your photo library to allow you to select photos for poem
			generation.
			The App requests photo library access via the platform's standard permission flow.</li>
		<li><strong>AI Service:</strong> When you generate a poem, the selected photos and your chosen options (theme,
			style, language, length)
			are sent to the AI service provider's API to generate the poem. This data is transmitted only when you explicitly
			initiate poem generation.</li>
		<li><strong>Local storage:</strong> The App stores generated poems, user preferences, and favorites locally on your
			device.
			No account or user registration is required.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2. What the App collects</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Selected photos:</strong> When you select photos from your library for poem generation, these photos
			are temporarily accessed and sent to the AI service API only when you initiate poem generation.</li>
		<li><strong>Generation options:</strong> Your chosen theme, style, language, and poem length are sent to the AI
			service
			to customize the generated poem.</li>
		<li><strong>Generated poems:</strong> Poems generated by the AI service are saved locally on your device in the
			app's poem library.</li>
		<li><strong>User preferences:</strong> The App stores your preferences (favorite poems, language settings) locally
			on your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. How the App uses and shares data</h2>

	<p>The App uses photo library access strictly to allow you to select photos for poem generation. Selected photos and
		generation options are sent to the AI service provider's API only when you explicitly initiate poem generation.
		Generated poems are saved locally on your device by default.</p>

	<p>Komore does not collect, store, or share your photos or generated poems with third parties except as necessary
		to provide the AI poem generation service. The app does not include third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>

	<h2>4. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>

	<p>The App uses an AI service provider's API to generate poems from your selected photos. When you generate a poem,
		your photos and options are sent to this service. The app does not include third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.
		The App relies on system frameworks for photo library access. Any communications performed by system services
		(for example: iCloud photo syncing or App Store calls) are governed by Apple's privacy policies.</p>

	<h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>

	<p>Generated poems and user preferences are stored locally on your device. To remove generated poems, delete them
		from within the app's poem library. Deleting the app removes all locally stored data including generated poems
		and preferences.</p>

	<h2>6. Your privacy rights</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Access:</strong> Because Komore does not create user accounts or centralize data on servers, your
			generated poems and settings remain on-device. You can access generated poems within the app's poem library.</li>
		<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete generated poems from within the app. To clear all local app data,
			delete the app from your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>7. Security</h2>

	<p>The App stores data locally on your device. Sensitive operations such as in-app purchases are handled by
		platform-managed services.</p>

	<h2>8. Children</h2>

	<p>The App is appropriate for general audiences. Narda does not knowingly target or collect information from
		children under applicable age thresholds.</p>

	<h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or the law. The "Last updated" date indicates when
		this document was last revised.</p>

	<h2>10. App permissions &amp; usage strings (Info.plist)</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Photo Library: "We need access to your photo library so you can select photos for poem generation."</li>
	</ul>
