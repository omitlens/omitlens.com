			</header>

			<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-11-14</p>

			<p>Perfora is a small photo-editing app that overlays film sprocket holes and film frame styles on images. This
				Privacy Policy explains how Perfora collects and uses device features and local data when you use the App.</p>

			<h2>1. Data and device features the App uses</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> The App saves edited photos to your photo library. When possible the App
					creates a dedicated album named <em>Perfora</em> in the user's Photos library and writes edited images
					there. The App may read the library to show recent photos when the user grants permission.</li>
				<li><strong>Local storage &amp; diagnostics:</strong> The App stores local preferences and small usage
					counters (for example: number of edits) on the device. Logs and debugging information are stored
					locally and are not sent to third-party analytics services by default.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>2. What the App collects</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Photos you edit:</strong> When you edit photos using Perfora, the resulting image file may be
					written to the photo library, typically inside the "Perfora" album the App creates. The App may add
					simple metadata (for example: app/software name) to the image file for convenience.</li>
				<li><strong>Local usage statistics:</strong> The App keeps local counters and timestamps (edits made, last
					used) to show small-scale usage information in the app UI.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>3. How the App uses and shares data</h2>

			<p>The App uses photo library access strictly to provide core app features: import, process, and save photos.
				Images and local statistics remain on your device unless you explicitly share them using the system share
				sheet or export features.</p>

			<p>Perfora does not transmit photos or usage statistics to external servers by default and does not include
				third-party analytics SDKs.</p>

			<h2>4. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>

			<p>The codebase does not include third-party analytics or tracking SDKs. The App relies on system frameworks
				for photo library operations. Any communications performed by system services (for example: iCloud photo
				syncing or App Store calls) are governed by Apple's privacy policies.</p>

			<h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>

			<p>Photos saved by Perfora are written to your device's photo library. To remove these photos, delete them from
				the Photos app. Local app settings and counters are stored on-device; deleting the app removes most local
				data.</p>

			<h2>6. Your privacy rights</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Access:</strong> Because Perfora does not create user accounts or centralize data on servers,
					your photos and settings remain on-device. You can access saved photos via the Photos app.</li>
				<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete photos via the Photos app to remove images saved by Perfora. To
					clear local app data, delete the app from your device.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>7. Security</h2>

			<p>The App stores data locally on your device. Sensitive operations such as in-app purchases are handled by
				platform-managed services.</p>

			<h2>8. Children</h2>

			<p>The App is appropriate for general audiences. Perfora does not knowingly target or collect information
				from children under applicable age thresholds.</p>

			<h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

			<p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or the law. The "Last updated" date indicates when
				this document was last revised.</p>

			<h2>10. App permissions &amp; usage strings (Info.plist)</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Photo Library: "We save edited photos to a Perfora album in your photo library."</li>
			</ul>
