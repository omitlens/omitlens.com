	<h1>Outside Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-08</p>

	<p>Outside is an app that helps you create collages of your own unique window view while discovering your inner world.
		This Privacy Policy explains how Outside collects and uses device features and data when you use the App.</p>

	<h2>1. Data and device features the App uses</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> The App accesses your photo library to allow you to select photos for creating
			window view collages. The App requests photo library access via the platform's standard permission flow.</li>
		<li><strong>Local storage:</strong> The App stores your collages, user preferences, and collections locally on your
			device.
			No account or user registration is required.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>2. What the App collects</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Selected photos:</strong> When you select photos from your library for collage creation, these photos
			are accessed and stored locally within your collage.</li>
		<li><strong>Collages:</strong> The App stores your created window view collages locally on your device.</li>
		<li><strong>User preferences:</strong> The App stores your preferences and collections locally on your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>3. How the App uses and shares data</h2>

	<p>The App uses photo library access strictly to allow you to select photos for creating window view collages.
		All collages and selections are processed and stored locally on your device.</p>

	<p>Outside does not collect, store, or share your photos or collages with third parties. The app does not include
		third-party analytics or tracking SDKs and does not transmit any data to external services.</p>

	<h2>4. Third-party services and SDKs</h2>

	<p>The App does not use any external services or AI APIs. All collage creation and processing happens locally on your
		device.
		The App relies on system frameworks for photo library access. Any communications performed by system services
		(for example: iCloud photo syncing or App Store calls) are governed by Apple's privacy policies.</p>

	<h2>5. Data retention and deletion</h2>

	<p>Your collages and preferences are stored locally on your device. To remove a collage, delete it from within the
		app.
		Deleting the app removes all locally stored data including collages and preferences.</p>

	<h2>6. Your privacy rights</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Access:</strong> Because Outside does not create user accounts or centralize data on servers, your
			collages and settings remain on-device. You can access all your collages within the app.</li>
		<li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete collages from within the app. To clear all local app data,
			delete the app from your device.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>7. Security</h2>

	<p>The App stores data locally on your device. Sensitive operations such as in-app purchases are handled by
		platform-managed services.</p>

	<h2>8. Children</h2>

	<p>The App is appropriate for general audiences. Outside does not knowingly target or collect information from
		children under applicable age thresholds.</p>

	<h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or the law. The "Last updated" date indicates when
		this document was last revised.</p>

	<h2>10. App permissions &amp; usage strings (Info.plist)</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Photo Library: "We need access to your photo library so you can select photos for creating window view
			collages."</li>
	</ul>
